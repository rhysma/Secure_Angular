# Secure From Scratch - Angular / .NET Workshop
This repository contains a re-work of the secure coding lab provided by the team as Secure From Scratch:[https://github.com/SecureFromScratch/Workshops]. The lab has been scaled down and re-worked to be accessible by a student audience. This workshop is designed to help you learn and practice secure coding practices.
