# Secure From Scratch - Angular / .NET Workshop
This repository contains a re-work of the secure coding lab provided by the team as [Secure From Scratch](https://github.com/SecureFromScratch/Workshops). The lab has been scaled down and re-worked to be accessible by a student audience. This workshop is designed to help you learn and practice secure coding practices.

## Getting to know the lab project
This project is a simulated recipe application
1. The front-end recipes-app has been written in Angular 17
2. The back-end recipes-api has been written in .NET 8.0
3. The application is designed to work with a local instance of SQL Server
4. The extras folder contains text and an image for the recipes application
5. This repo includes a C# console application named AttackerConsole that can be used to run simulated attacks on the application

## Preparing for the workshop
If you wish to follow along during the workshop, you will need to have the application set up on your computer and running. To do so, follow these steps.
1. Clone this repo and download the contents so you have the files
2. Download SQL Server so you have a localhost database the application can use
